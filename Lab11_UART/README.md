# Lab11_UART subject

Lab achieved with a score of 100% in simulation and real board tests.

## Purpose

In Lab11 you will learn how to write software that converts numbers into ASCII strings and display the string on the display connected to UART0.

## System Requirements

- When debugging in the simulator you will observe output in the UART debugging window. 
- When running on the real board you will run the terminal program TExaSdisplay. 

The main program is given and should be used to test your software. \
During debugging feel free to edit the main program, but during both simulation and real-board grading the main program must remain as it exists in the starter. \
The graders use this main program to control and test your solution.

The grader will activate the PLL so the system runs at 80 MHz, you must not modify this rate.

## Completed files

`UART.c` - file for UART functions
`main.c` - main file
